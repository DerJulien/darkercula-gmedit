* Click "manage" on the "Themes" section
* Unzip a [release](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/dracula-gmedit/releases) (dracula.zip) into themes directory so that you have `.../themes/darkercula/config.json`
* Restart GMEdit
* Pick Menu > Preferences again
* If all is well, you should be able to select the "dracula" theme now.
